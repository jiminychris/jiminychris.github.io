         \surprise his family. DADDY CANE (65)
         \sits on a rocker on the porch.  Still
         \spry, good looking. He sits with MARGO,
         \pretty, Billy's family friend since

=DADDY CANE
Well, look how you've grown!

=BILLY CANE
Daddy!

=DADDY CANE
So good to see you, son.

You win the war all by yourself?

=BILLY CANE
I had a little help.

=DADDY CANE
Well, I salute you.

Then you salute us all.

Hi, Billy.

=DADDY CANE
         \(then)
Look who I'm visiting with!

=BILLY CANE
Margo! Is that you? You've grown every which-a-way.

         \(They hug, a friendly one.)

=MARGO
I was just delivering a book your Daddy ordered.

=BILLY CANE
         \(all in fun)
Now Daddy, have you been reading again?

=DADDY CANE
         \(playing along)
I have, son.

=BILLY CANE
Daddy, I've warned you about reading. That could make you smart.

=DADDY CANE
I know, call the hillbilly police.

=MARGO
Mr. Cane, Billy's been sending me his stories from overseas, and I've got a stack of them all edited.

=BILLY CANE
And I got published in Stars and Stripes!

=MARGO
Billy!

=BILLY CANE
         \(to MARGO)
Did you get my latest?

=MARGO
I sure did. You can come by the bookstore and pick it up.

=BILLY CANE
Well, what'd you think?

=MARGO
You don't have to know everything all at once.

=BILLY CANE
Margo, that is so you! Mama inside? Or are you making her plow again, Daddy?

         \(MARGO and DADDY CANE look quickly at
         \each other.)

=MARGO
Billy, I've got to get back.

=DADDY CANE
Why don't you pick a floribunda rose, son? That was her favorite.

         \(Lights change, BILLY and DADDY CANE
         \walk into the graveyard. BILLY carries
         \a rose.)

Here she is. Under the walnut tree.

         \(A gravestone angel marks her grave.)

=BILLY CANE
You bought her a gravestone angel.

=DADDY CANE
There was this lovely one in the back of Julia Wolfe's garage. She made me a nice deal on it as a courtesy.

=BILLY CANE
It's beautiful.

=DADDY CANE
The owls are speaking tonight. I'll go hear what they have to say.

         \(He does.)

=BILLY CANE
         \(to the gravestone)
Mama, when I was in mud up to my knees, I thought it would be you mourning me. Not this way round.

         \(He puts the rose on the grave, then
         \looks around.)

=BILLY CANE (CONT'D)
And, I'm sorry that daddy put an angel over your grave. You used to make fun of people for doing that. You said you'd rather let your deeds speak for your time on Earth.
         \(then)
Mama, thank you for the way you raised me. The way you spoke, your parlance around the house, made me a curious lover of words, and you always pointed me toward the writers who used them well. Remember when you had me copy stories out of the Asheville Southern Journal, just so I'd know what it feels like to write well?
         \(he kneels)
I made it back home like you always said I would. But I never thought homecoming could be so cruel.

You are my Mama, and I place my hand here...

         \hands a book to MAX, a young customer.)

=MARGO
Here it is, Max. Since when did you become such an avid reader?

=MAX
Since you took over the bookstore. When you stopped working at the soda shop I lost three pounds. Margo, would you like to go to the movies sometime?

=MARGO
I don't want you to spend your money on me.

=MAX
It would be cheaper than buying all these books!

         \(MAX sighs and leaves. BILLY enters.)

=FLORENCE
Hi, Billy.

=BILLY CANE
Margo. Sorry, it took me a while to make it in.

=MARGO
I thought it might. How are things with Daddy?

=BILLY CANE
He's doing better. It's strange. We both swear we can hear her call out to us sometimes.

=MARGO
How are you doing?

=BILLY CANE
I started writing again. And that brings me comfort.
         \(then, picking up a book from the
         \counter)
A thesaurus? Are you writing now?

=MARGO
No, Max just returned it. He thought it was a book about dinosaurs.
         \(then)
Oh, and Billy, I read the story you sent me.

=BILLY CANE
I've been wondering about that. What'd you think?

=MARGO

Well, it started out great...but...

=BILLY CANE
Oh.

=MARGO
Then it got better and better!

=BILLY CANE

=MARGO
Billy, you've grown up and so has your writing.

         \(She retrieves his stories from a
         \shelf.)

Now, I caught a few typos and retyped it on heavy bond. In fact, I retyped them all!

=BILLY CANE
         \(earnest)
Thank you. Thank you.
         \(then)
Margo, I've been thinking. What if...what if I submitted some of these stories to the Asheville Southern Journal?

Oh, Billy! Yes. Yes. You were always so tentative about it. What made you decide that?

=DARYL
Good question, because this sign is often wrong.

Don't mind Daryl.

If someone wanted to submit some stories to your magazine....

=LUCY
Let me hand them to the nice man.

         \(LUCY takes BILLY's manuscript, gives
         \it to DARYL who starts to put it in the

Then wave them goodbye.

=BILLY CANE
Why wave them goodbye?

         \(BILLY retrieves the manuscript from
         \the trash can.)

=DARYL
Because our editor, Miss Alice Murphy, is one of the keenest editors in America. The New Yorker magazine sent people down here to try and hire her away.

=LUCY
But she wants to stay right here in North Carolina.

=BILLY CANE
That's good!

=DARYL
Not for young tadpoles like you.

=LUCY
She once made Ernest Hemmingway cry. He lay right there, banged his fists on the floor and sobbed.

=BILLY CANE
Why?

=LUCY
He used the word "their" as a singular pronoun.

=BILLY CANE
Look, I came all the way from Hayes Creek and I gotta get back, so...

=DARYL
Well, aren't we busy.

=BILLY CANE
Can I pick up my stories tomorrow?

=DARYL
Look, you think we're going to read them by tomorrow, if at all?

I'm sorry but we don't even read young writers anymore without a whopping letter of recommendation.

=DARYL
Hmm. Now where did that door go? Oh! There it is...

You can leave your stories here. I'm a great admirer of Thomas Wolfe.

=ALICE
Mr. Ames, hand me those stories. I'm going to read them.

=DARYL
Why?

=ALICE
Because he's a liar, and liars sometimes make very good story tellers. Now, what about the new submissions?

=DARYL
We have several. This one from...
         \(reads)
Carl Sandburg.

=ALICE
Well, we should certainly look at that.

=DARYL
Tennessee Williams.

=ALICE
A very promising new writer. Yes.

=DARYL
And one from Joseph Algonquin.

=ALICE
Another one? He's always terrible.

=DARYL
Miss Murphy, it's time you knew. Joseph Algonquin is my pen name.

=ALICE
Oh. Well, maybe you've improved. I'll take a look at it.

=DARYL
Don't bother.

         \(He dumps it.)

=LUCY
Miss Murphy, there's a dance at the Shiny Penny tonight.

=ALICE
And?

=DARYL
Those officers returning home keep asking about you.

=LUCY
When a female walks in that place there isn't a head that doesn't swivel.

=ALICE
No. Tonight I want to cozy up to a few unnecessary adverbs and then cut their heads off.

=DARYL
I've heard stories about you, Miss Murphy, you weren't always such a wallflower.

=ALICE
No, not always.

Okay. You remind me of Adonis. You know who Adonis is?

Application for college. I've been thinking about it.

Four years away from home when everything you need to learn
I'm teaching you here within these walls? Your grandfather
taught me and I teach you. That chain must not be broken.

Well, Daddy, I understand, but I thought we'd discussed
this.

The Conklins? In Charlotte? What about them?

=MAYOR
They've got a beautiful daughter. Ola.

=STANFORD
Well, a daughter with resources.

=JIMMY RAY
Stanford, what exactly isn't your business?

=MAYOR
The Conklins are a family with produce trucks that drive
across this state, and we are the second biggest purveyors
of produce for three hundred miles.

=JIMMY RAY
You want me to marry someone for her trucks?

Mr. Cane, your latest submission is a bit of a mess. What's
going on?

I'm sorry, Miss Murphy. I'd sent it to Margo and hadn't

Miss Murphy, what do you think of it?

=ALICE

         \(then)
You look shocked.

=BILLY CANE
I always thought that was pronounced "superFLUous."

And, you should open with your second paragraph, not the
first. The action begins there.

Turn it into a lullaby because it put me to sleep. Look.

         \(She shows him the heavily penciled
         \manuscript.)

=BILLY CANE
Anything else?

You have to cut the word "twixt."

=BILLY CANE
Wait, what's the matter with "twixt?" You don't like
"twixt?"

=ALICE
Use "between."

=BILLY CANE
Why?

=ALICE
Because a man wrote this, not Tinkerbell.
         \(then)
And the second to the last paragraph should be cut.

What? I cried when I wrote that.

=ALICE
Clearly. It's as purple as a baboon's butt.

=BILLY CANE
         \(shocked)

And then there's this last sentence. It flows nicely, but
I'm curious.

word ninety-nine percent of our readers would have to look
up?

Dot dot dot, "the longing of the human heart and its search
for propinquity."

=BILLY CANE
I did that on purpose, Miss Murphy.

=ALICE
Why?

=BILLY CANE
It's the only five-dollar word in the whole piece. And
because of it, I get the impact of the ending twice. The
reader lands on a striking word with an elegant cadence.
"Propinquity." Then, the reader goes to the dictionary...
         \(he mimes the action of picking up a
         \dictionary)

Better than that. I want to be a censor.

=BILLY CANE
A censor? Why a censor?

=LUCY
When I was twelve, I gave my father a Raymond Chandler
mystery novel. I was watching him read it and suddenly, his
face went the color of a rose. He set the book face down
and called for my mother and took her into another part of
the house and shut the door. I went over to the book to see
what he had just read, and right there in the middle of the
page was the word "brassiere." I thought, "this must never
happen again." So now, a few nights a week, I take a
manuscript home, fix myself a Manhattan, and search for
hidden erotic content. Would you like to do that with me
sometime?

         \(to clerk)
Are these all the files for May 15th, 1924?

=CLERK
They are. The laws are changing this year. These records
won't be open anymore. Would you like me to help you
search? Again?

=ALICE
That would be so kind. The baby was wearing a...

=CLERK
I know, a blue sweater.

=ALICE
Maybe in one of the photos...

         \(They start to pour through another
         \file together.)

=CLERK
The photos are in black and white, Miss Murphy. Maybe he
wasn't dropped off in Raleigh. You should be trying some of
the surrounding towns. Charlotte has an agency.

=ALICE
He was dropped off here. Kate, you remember anybody else
checking for a baby left here on the same date?

=CLERK
Not that I recall. Should there be?

=ALICE
I would think so.

=CLERK
I know this is hard to hear, but maybe he didn't care as
much as you.

=ALICE
If there's truth in this world, he cared. Somehow, he
would have come looking.

=CLERK
It's only me behind this counter for the last nineteen
years.

         \(she considers)
Well then that's a puzzle I should have sorted out before.

Hello, Jimmy Ray.

=JIMMY RAY
Alice. Young Alice.

=ALICE
Not so young.

=JIMMY RAY
Young forever in my memory.

=ALICE
This is your home. It's nice.

=JIMMY RAY
I worked hard over the years.

=ALICE
Those your kids?

=JIMMY RAY
In a way. They're my sister's kids.

=ALICE
You married?

=JIMMY RAY
No. I never married. Close, a couple of times.

=ALICE
I guess I would have heard. I followed you.

=JIMMY RAY
I know you never married. I paid attention. You did well in
Asheville. I had some trips there, looked up at your
building, never went in though.

=ALICE
Why not?

=JIMMY RAY
You moved on. You published Carson McCullers, Eudora
Welty....

=ALICE
You have been paying attention.

=JIMMY RAY
I always paid attention to you, Alice. If I didn't, I knew
I was in trouble.

=ALICE
We were so young.

=JIMMY RAY
We were, but I wonder...often, was I old enough to have
behaved differently, better.

=ALICE
Yes. When I came to Raleigh today, it wasn't my intention
to see you. I was at the hall of records. With the same
woman who has been there for twenty years. And I asked if
anyone else had looked for the whereabouts of our child.
And she said not one. Not one person. Not you.

=JIMMY RAY
I didn't, Alice.

=ALICE
And you never came to see me. Why?

=JIMMY RAY
Oh Alice. Is it better to hope or to know?

=ALICE
Please.

=JIMMY RAY
After my father died, we discovered it was he who had
funded your scholarship.

=ALICE
Why?

=JIMMY RAY
To get you out of town.
         \(then)
Guilt.

=ALICE
Guilt?

I think I'm seeing you in a new way.

What do you mean?

=BILLY CANE
Margo, since I came back from the war many things have
changed in my life.

=MARGO
Of course.

=BILLY CANE
And some things have remained constant. Family. This place,
Hayes Creek. But one thing has been both constant and
changing. And I wonder "how is that possible?"

Anything's possible with people. What is it?

=BILLY CANE
Us.

         \sits asleep on the porch.)

         \(She walks up, pauses to look at the
         \old place. It's been a long while. She

         \MURPHY can see her, and she puts down
         \her bags.)

=ALICE
Anybody home?

=DADDY MURPHY
Well, child. Just as promised.

         \(He hugs her.)

=ALICE
We're almost the same age now.

=DADDY MURPHY
Oh, I'm staying a bit ahead of you. So happy to see you,
darling, I didn't know if I was worth a visit any more.

=ALICE
Daddy, how can you say that?

=DADDY MURPHY
Through the years, reasonableness has laid its hand on my
shoulder, and things I've done in the past don't quite
stand up like they used to.
         \(Alice takes it in, then)
Do you want a glass of water?

=ALICE
Do you have any of that hooch?

=DADDY MURPHY
I do.

         \(He lifts a plank in the floor and
         \retrieves a bottle.)

=DADDY MURPHY (CONT'D)
How long can you stay?

=ALICE
Just one day.

=DADDY MURPHY
One day, darling. That's a short time to say a lot.

=ALICE
Mama here?

=DADDY MURPHY
She's at the neighbors; she'll be back. But I'm glad to
have you alone. I can talk to your Mama, but not about
certain things.

=ALICE
Sounds like you've been banking words, Daddy.

=DADDY MURPHY
You've got to around here.

         \(He stands, moves to the edge of the
         \porch.)

Them trees. Some nights it's so quiet you can hear a leaf
fall. And you can tell the color of that leaf just by the
tiny crisp crack it makes as it lights on the ground.

=ALICE
I know that feeling.
         \(then)
Sometimes I hear the fiddlers in town and I know they're
playing the sound of the wind over the lakes back home.
         \(then)
What kind of things can't you talk to Mama about?

         \(He pauses for a moment. Something is
         \hard for him to say.)

=DADDY MURPHY
Certainly not about things that occurred twenty-three years
ago.

=ALICE
No, not about things that occurred twenty~three years ago.

=DADDY MURPHY
That had to be the most painful day of your life.

         \(Silence.)

It was, wasn't it, sweetheart.

=ALICE
Oh, Daddy...

=DADDY MURPHY
It was.

=ALICE
Yes.

=DADDY MURPHY
Well, if shame could ever equal pain, I would say I know
how you feel. Because what I did that day made it the most
shameful day of my life.

=ALICE
Thank you, Daddy.

=DADDY MURPHY
I believe that was the last day my own daddy still had hold
of me. How I felt after that helped me purge him from me.

         \(ALICE hugs him.)

I don't ask for forgiveness...

=ALICE
Oh, Daddy, I forgi...

=DADDY MURPHY
         \(cuts her off)
No, Alice, I cannot even forgive myself.

         \(MAMA MURPHY enters silently, and
         \stands out of sight.)

I wonder what happened to the boy. Do you know, Alice?

=ALICE
I do, Daddy.
         \(she collects herself, then thinks
         \better of it)
He was adopted by a good family in California and raised
with very much love. He's educated, and successful, and
he's a fine young man.

That's what I wished for him all along.

Maybe your wishes made it so.

that.

Mary Lee?

That's my mother.

=DADDY CANE
Billy, you've got clothes here, you know that? Good pants
and some shirts. You ought to take 'em on over to your new
place.

I could use 'em, Daddy.

         \(BILLY goes inside.)

There must be some wonderful stories about your wife, Mr.
Cane. Maybe Billy should write about her.

Oh, I don't think so. Better to pick from the whole town,

It's lovely, Billy. Reminds me of Zebulon, in some ways.

You must find wonderful repose here, Mr. Cane.

         \distracted.)

Miss Murphy?

=ALICE
I'm sorry, Mr. Cane.
         \(collects herself)
Your wife must have died young. Billy's only twenty-three.

=DADDY CANE
Mary Lee died last year at sixty-five. She had Billy late
in life. That's a rarity around these parts, where
everyone's married and bearing kids before they can ride a
bike.

         \(ALICE still notices the suitcase.
         \Perhaps it starts to bother her.)

         \(calling to BILLY)

         \valise.)

I don't want to take up Miss Murphy's time with that. But
look what I found. A good pair of boots and my old baby
sweater! I want to show this to Margo.

$CENE 9

         \(1946. ASHEVILLE. SOUTHERN JOURNAL
         \OFFICE.)

         \(It's 10AM. DARYL and LUCY are there.)

=DARYL
Where is she? She's an hour and a half late. This is not
like her.

=LUCY
She got a notice from the post office that there's a
special delivery letter.

=DARYL
If they can send a notice why can't they send the letter?

=LUCY
She went over there with Jimmy Ray to pick it up.

=DARYL
She's pretty cozy with Jimmy Ray.

=LUCY
He's attractive, don't you think?

=DARYL
Oh Lucy, I don't know how to judge if a man's attractive.

=LUCY
Yes, you do.

         \(Then a commotion. ALICE and JIMMY RAY
         \enter the office, holding a manuscript,
         \laughing hysterically.)

=JIMMY RAY
         \(points to a line)
Read the next line!

=ALICE
         \(reading)
Oh, my lord!
         \(to DARYL)
Daryl, this is the funniest thing I've ever read. We've got
to run this in our humor column right away.

         \(She hands him the manuscript.)

=DARYL
What is it?

=ALICE
It's a hilarious piece by a writer I've never even heard
of. Lillian Jones.

=LUCY
Lillian Jones? Congratulations Daryl!

=ALICE
What?

=DARYL
         \(excited)
Lillian Jones is my new pen name!

=ALICE
Good for you!

=LUCY
Miss Murphy, you have been on a tear lately.

=DARYL
You have. Miss Murphy, may I be frank?

=ALICE
Well, it'll take a while to get used to calling you that,
but sure.

=DARYL
What's come over you? I really miss the dark layer of gloom
that you brought to work with you every day.

=ALICE
Oh, all right. Look, everyone's going to find out sooner or
later. Years ago I had a child.

=LUCY
Daryl, you owe me five dollars.

=ALICE
Well, I found out he's alive and well, and raised by
another family. He's a fine young man, and it turns out he
works for me.

=LUCY
Works for...? Oh my God. It's Daryl!

=ALICE
It's Billy.

=DARYL
Billy?

         \(LUCY and DARYL gasp.)

=LUCY
When was the last time you spoke to him?

=ALICE
The night he found out. A month now. He hasn't written or
called. But these things take time, don't you think?

=JIMMY RAY
I'm thinking of taking a trip just to lay eyes on him. I
wouldn't know him if I saw him.

         \(BILLY enters, with MARGO.)

=BILLY CANE
Hello.

=JIMMY RAY
Oh my God.

=ALICE
Hello.

=BILLY CANE
         \(to JIMMY RAY)
Hello. Billy Cane.

=JIMMY RAY
You're a handsome boy. You take after your father. And that
would be me.

=BILLY CANE
Honored to meet you, sir.

=DARYL
Lucy, shall we go look for that pencil box?

=LUCY
The missing pencil box? Yes.

         \(They remove themselves upstage, but
         \turn to listen.)

=DARYL
Now where is that pencil box?

=BILLY CANE
Miss Murphy, I came to apologize.

=ALICE
You don't have to apolo...

=BILLY CANE
I do. I was selfish. All I thought about was how I was hurt
that night. But it was not just me; it was every one of us.

=ALICE
Oh, Billy.

=BILLY CANE
So I went to the site of my real birth: a small cabin in
the woods.

=ALICE
How did you find it?

=BILLY CANE
Your father loves you very much. He led me to the cabin and
told the story of that awful night. How I was torn from
your arms. And I understood that truth walks beside us like
a shadow, and one day it merges with us. Until it does, we
are not truly whole.

=JIMMY RAY
         \(awe)
Billy, you are no doubt your mother's son,

=BILLY CANE
Lucy, I owe you an apology, too. Perhaps I was a little
misleading.

=LUCY
         \(extends her hand)
Well we can start fresh...

=MARGO
Ahem! Hello everyone, I'm Margo. I'm Billy's fiancée.

=BILLY CANE
Oh Margo, you are? Thanks for letting me know! Whoo ha!

         \(He swings her around. Then...)

=JIMMY RAY
Alice, are you going to the wedding?

=ALICE
Well, of course I am. He's my son!

=JIMMY RAY
Not theirs. Ours.

         \(JIMMY RAY walks to her.)

=ALICE
         \(after a pause)
Lucy, put "getting married" on my calendar.

=DARYL
Now that's the Miss Murphy we know and love.
