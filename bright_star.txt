          (1945. LIMBO)

/ALICE
     IF YOU KNEW MY STORY
     YOU'D HAVE A HARD TIME

     MY CARES AND MY WOES ROLLED UP IN MY SOCKS
     I LAID DOWN IN THAT MOUNTAIN STREAM
     AND THE ICY WATER RUSHED OVER ME

          (The stage set spins. BILLY is
          approaching home.)

$SCENE 2

          (1945. BILLY'S HOME. OUTSIDE HAYES
          CREEK.)

          (BILLY walks gently up the road to
          surprise his family. DADDY CANE (65)
          sits on a rocker on the porch.  Still
          spry, good looking. He sits with MARGO,
          pretty, Billy's family friend since
          childhood. Daddy Cane sees him.)

/DADDY CANE
Well, look how you've grown!

/BILLY CANE
Daddy!

/DADDY CANE
So good to see you, son.

          (They hug each other.)

You win the war all by yourself?

/BILLY CANE
I had a little help.

/DADDY CANE
Well, I salute you.

/BILLY CANE
Then you salute us all.

          (They face each other, man to man.)

/MARGO
Hi, Billy.

/DADDY CANE
          (then)
Look who I'm visiting with!

/BILLY CANE
Margo! Is that you? You've grown every which-a-way.

          (They hug, a friendly one.)

/MARGO
I was just delivering a book your Daddy ordered.

/BILLY CANE
          (all in fun)
Now Daddy, have you been reading again?

/DADDY CANE
          (playing along)
I have, son.

/BILLY CANE
Daddy, I've warned you about reading. That could make you smart.

/DADDY CANE
I know, call the hillbilly police.

/MARGO
Mr. Cane, Billy's been sending me his stories from overseas, and I've got a stack of them all edited.

/BILLY CANE
And I got published in Stars and Stripes!

/MARGO
Billy!

/BILLY CANE
          (to MARGO)
Did you get my latest?

/MARGO
I sure did. You can come by the bookstore and pick it up.

/BILLY CANE
Well, what'd you think?

/MARGO
You don't have to know everything all at once.

/BILLY CANE
Margo, that is so you! Mama inside? Or are you making her plow again, Daddy?

          (MARGO and DADDY CANE look quickly at
          each other.)

/MARGO
Billy, I've got to get back.

          (She hugs him one more time, deeper.
          She exits, after taking a last look at
          DADDY CANE.)

/BILLY CANE
What's gotten into her? And where is Mama?
          (yells)
Mama!

#2 SHE'S GONE




What is it, Daddy?

          (DADDY CANE walks to BILLY, wraps his
          arms around him, holds him. BILLY
          understands.)

/DADDY CANE
No way to write you, son.

          (DADDY CANE turns and faces BILLY.)

     WE HAD A VISITOR
     WHILE YOU WERE AWAY
     UNWELCOME AS HE WAS
     HE CAME ON IN ONE DAY

     HE SAT DOWN QUIETLY AT YOUR MOTHER'S SIDE
     SHE LEFT WITH HIM SOMETIME IN THE NIGHT
     SHE'S GONE
     YOU KNOW HOW MUCH SHE LOVED YOU SON

     SHE HAD NO FEAR OF DEATH
     SHE WENT ON PEACEFULLY

     SHE JUST CLOSED HER EYES
     AND DRIFTED OFF TO SLEEP

/BILLY AND DADDY CANE
     SHE'S GONE
     SHE'S GONE

/DADDY CANE
     YOU KNOW HOW MUCH SHE LOVED YOU SON

/BILLY AND DADDY CANE
     LET'S WALK ON OVER THERE AND LAY
     A ROSE UPON HER GRAVE

/DADDY CANE
Why don't you pick a floribunda rose, son? That was her favorite.

          (Lights change, BILLY and DADDY CANE
          walk into the graveyard. BILLY carries
          a rose.)

Here she is. Under the walnut tree.

          (A gravestone angel marks her grave.)

/BILLY CANE
You bought her a gravestone angel.

/DADDY CANE
There was this lovely one in the back of Julia Wolfe's garage. She made me a nice deal on it as a courtesy.

/BILLY CANE
It's beautiful.

/DADDY CANE
The owls are speaking tonight. I'll go hear what they have to say.

          (He does.)

/BILLY CANE
          (to the gravestone)
Mama, when I was in mud up to my knees, I thought it would be you mourning me. Not this way round.

          (He puts the rose on the grave, then
          looks around.)

/BILLY CANE (CONT'D)
And, I'm sorry that daddy put an angel over your grave. You used to make fun of people for doing that. You said you'd rather let your deeds speak for your time on Earth.
          (then)
Mama, thank you for the way you raised me. The way you spoke, your parlance around the house, made me a curious lover of words, and you always pointed me toward the writers who used them well. Remember when you had me copy stories out of the Asheville Southern Journal, just so I'd know what it feels like to write well?
          (he kneels)
I made it back home like you always said I would. But I never thought homecoming could be so cruel.

#2A SCENE CHANGE

You are my Mama, and I place my hand here...
          (he puts his hand on the dirt)
...to touch you now and forever.

/BILLY AND DADDY CANE
     SHE'S GONE
     SHE'S GONE

/DADDY CANE
     YOU KNOW HOW MUCH SHE LOVED YOU SON


          [FADE OUT:]

$SCENE 3

          (1945. MARGO'S BOOKSHOP.)

          (MARGO runs a modest bookshop. There
          are a few customers in the shop. She
          hands a book to MAX, a young customer.)

/MARGO
Here it is, Max. Since when did you become such an avid reader?

/MAX
Since you took over the bookstore. When you stopped working at the soda shop I lost three pounds. Margo, would you like to go to the movies sometime?

/MARGO
I don't want you to spend your money on me.

/MAX
It would be cheaper than buying all these books!

          (MAX sighs and leaves. BILLY enters.)

/FLORENCE
Hi, Billy.

/BILLY CANE
Margo. Sorry, it took me a while to make it in.

/MARGO
I though it might. How are things with Daddy?

/BILLY CANE
He's doing better. It's strange. We both swear we can hear her call out to us sometimes.

/MARGO
How are you doing?

/BILLY CANE
I started writing again. And that brings me comfort.
          (then, picking up a book from the
          counter)
A thesaurus? Are you writing now?

/MARGO
No, Max just returned it. He thought it was a book about dinosaurs.
          (then)
Oh, and Billy, I read the story you sent me.

/BILLY CANE
I've been wondering about that. What'd you think?

/MARGO
          (teasing)
Well, it started out great...but...

/BILLY CANE
Oh.

/MARGO
Then it got better and better!

/BILLY CANE
It did?

/MARGO
Billy, you've grown up and so has your writing.

          (She retrieves his stories from a
          shelf.)

Now, I caught a few typos and retyped it on heavy bond. In fact, I retyped them all!

/BILLY CANE
          (earnest)
Thank you. Thank oyu.
          (then)
Margo, I've been thinking. What if...what if I submitted some of these stories to the Asheville Southern Journal?

/MARGO
Oh, Billy! Yes. Yes. You were always so tentative about it. What made you decide that?


#3 BRIGHT STAR

/BILLY CANE
     I'M READY FOR MY LIFE TO BEGIN
     I'M READY FOR IT ALL TO START
     MY HEART'S ABOUT TO BUST
     DON'T LEAD THE WAY I MUST
     FOLLOW MY OWN BRIGHT STAR

/MARGO
Edna, we still have that special delivery stamp I've been saving?

/EDNA
We sure do.

/BILLY CANE
I'm not mailing them, Margo. I'm going to hand-carry them to Asheville, and sleep like a dog on their doorstep until I get published.

/FLORENCE
          (exiting)
Good luck, Billy.

/BILLY CANE
     MANY A LONG COLD NIGHT
     I HUDDLED DOWN IN THE DARK
     I MADE A VOW IF I EVER MADE IT OUT
     I'D FOLLOW MY OWN BRIGHT STAR

     BRIGHT STAR
     KEEP SHINING FOR ME
     SHINE ON AND SEE ME THROUGH

     BRIGHT STAR
     KEEP SHINING FOR ME
     AND ONE DAY I'LL SHINE FOR YOU

          (BILLY hugs MARGO, and exits the
          bookstore.)

/MARGO
For what it's worth, I'll [miss you]...

          (But BILLY is gone.)

          (We begin a travel montage of him
          heading for Asheville.)

$SCENE 4

          (1945. ASHEVILLE. LOBBY OF THE
          ASHEVILLE SOUTHERN JOURNAL.)

          (A busy office. The front desk is
          manned by DARYL AMES. LUCY GRANT, an
          editor, mans her station. The desk
          bears a sign: "Asheville Southern
          Journal". BILLY enters, holding his
          manuscript.)

/BILLY CANE
          (to DARYL)
Hello, is this the Asheville Southern Journal?

          (DARYL leans over and cranes to read
          the lettering on the front of his
          desk.)

/DARYL
Good question, because this sign is often wrong.

/LUCY
Don't mind Daryl.

/BILLY CANE
If someone wanted to submit some stories to your magazine....

/LUCY
Let me hand them to the nice man.

          (LUCY takes BILLY's manuscript, gives
          it to DARYL who starts to put it in the
          "round file.")

/DARYL
Then wave them goodbye.

/BILLY CANE
Why wave them goodbye?

          (BILLY retrieves the manuscript from
          the trash can.)

/DARYL
Because our editor, Miss Alice Murphy, is one of the keenest editors in America. The New Yorker magazine sent people down here to try and hire her away.

/LUCY
But she wants to stay right here in North Carolina.

/BILLY CANE
That's good!

/DARYL
Not for young tadpoles like you.

/LUCY
She once made Ernest Hemmingway cry. He lay right there, banged his fists on the floor and sobbed.

/BILLY CANE
Why?

/LUCY
He used the word "their" as a singular pronoun.

/BILLY CANE
Look, I came all the way from Hayes Creek and I gotta get back, so...

/DARYL
Well, aren't we busy.

/BILLY CANE
Can I pick up my stories tomorrow?

          (DARYL and LUCY both laugh.)

/DARYL
Look, you think we're going to read them by tomorrow, if at all?

/LUCY
I'm sorry but we don't even read young writers anymore without a whopping letter of recommendation.

/DARYL
Hmm. Now where did that door go? Oh! There it is...

          (He walks BILLY to the door. Miss ALICE
          MURPHY enters (38). Trim, prim. All
          business.)

/BILLY CANE
Thomas Wolfe read them.

/ALICE
Thomas Wolfe?

/BILLY CANE
He read them and wrote me back saying I had talent. I sent them to him last year.

/ALICE
You can leave your stories here. I'm a great admirer of Thomas Wolfe.

/BILLY CANE
Well, thank you. I will tell him you said that. You must be Miss Murphy.

/ALICE
I don't have to be, but I am.

/BILLY CANE
          (to the room)
I'll wait to hear from you. I'm William Cane.

/DARYL
I'm writing your name down...
          (writes in the air)
William.

          (DARYL starts to write. BILLY exits. As
          soon as he does, DARYL tosses the paper
          in the trash.)

/ALICE
Mr. Ames, hand me those stories. I'm going to read them.

/DARYL
Why?

/ALICE
Because he's a liar, and liars sometimes make very good story tellers. Now, what about the new submissions?

/DARYL
We have several. This one from...
          (reads)
Carl Sandburg.

/ALICE
Well, we should certainly look at that.

/DARYL
Tennessee Williams.

/ALICE
A very promising new writer. Yes.

/DARYL
And one from Joseph Algonquin.

/ALICE
Another one? He's always terrible.

/DARYL
Miss Murphy, it's time you knew. Joseph Algonquin is my pen name.

/ALICE
Oh. Well, maybe you've improved. I'll take a look at it.

/DARYL
Don't bother.

          (He dumps it.)

/LUCY
Miss Murphy, there's a dance at the Shiny Penny tonight.

/ALICE
And?

/DARYL
Those officers returning home keep asking about you.

/LUCY
When a female walks in that place there isn't a head that doesn't swivel.

/ALICE
No. Tonight I want to cozy up to a few unnecessary adverbs and then cut their heads off.

/DARYL
I've heard stories about you, Miss Murphy, you weren't always such a wallflower.

/ALICE
No, not always.

#4 WAY BACK IN THE DAY

/DARYL
The whole world is rejoicing about the war being over.

/LUCY
And you should get out and celebrate, too. Come with us; just this once.

/ALICE
     WAY BACK IN THE DAY
     I WOULD HAVE GONE WITH YOU
     WAY BACK IN THE DAY
     YOU COULD NOT HAVE KEPT ME AWAY

     I WAS THE LIFE OF THE PARTY
     I WAS HAPPY AND CAREFREE
     DANCING ON THE FLOOR WITH EVERYBODY
     HE WAS NEXT TO ME

     WE'D SING AND WE'D SWAY
     TO EVERY SONG TOGETHER
     WAY BACK IN THE DAY

     I COULD NOT WAIT TO GET AWAY
     MOONLIGHT MUSIC FROM ACROSS THE RIVER
     CALLING, PLAYING THROUGH THE NIGHT

     I WOULD RUN BAREFOOT THROUGH THE SOUNDS OF SUMMER
     TO BE WITH EVERYONE

/ENSEMBLE
     AHH...

/ALICE AND ENSEMBLE
     WAY BACK IN THE DAY

/ALICE                         /ENSEMBLE
     YOU NEVER WOULD HAVE           |OOH.
     HAD TO ASK ME                  |

/ALICE AND ENSEMBLE
     WAY BACK IN THE DAY

/ALICE
     I'D HAVE BEEN THE FIRST ONE TO SAY

          (ALICE changes her look to her younger
          self, North Carolina rural 1923.)

/ALICE AND ENSEMBLE
     COME ON WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR
     IT'S ALL GOING ON OUTSIDE OF YOUR DOOR

/ALICE
     I WON'T TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER
     YOU'RE COMING OUT WITH ME

$SCENE 5

          (1923. A HOUSE IN THE VERY SMALL TOWN
          OF ZEBULON, NORTH CAROLINA.)

          (JIMMY RAY (20), the Mayor's son, works
          outdoors under a tree. He fiddles with
          an old ice box on the street. ALICE
          enters, now age 16.)

          (She approaches Jimmy Ray.)

/ALICE
Now that's a sight. The Mayor's son with his sleeves rolled up repairing an ice box.

/JIMMY RAY
Well, if it isn't the little princess of Zebulon. Princess, what's the matter with repairing an ice box?

/ALICE
Jimmy Ray, an ice box has no moving parts. My granny could repair an ice box. There's ice and a box. I think you're just showing off your muscles.

/JIMMY RAY
Keep talking, Alice Murphy. I'm curious how your mind works.

/ALICE
Okay. You remind me of Adonis. You know who Adonis is?

/JIMMY RAY
I sure do. He's a Greek God.

/ALICE
Well, you remind me of him. In fact, you remind me of the myth of Adonis when he repaired the ice box.

/JIMMY RAY
You ever think you might be too smart for this town?

/ALICE
All the time.

/JIMMY RAY
What makes you so sure?

/ALICE
I entered an essay contest in Raleigh. The first prize was five dollars, and I won it.

/JIMMY RAY
What was it about?

/ALICE
I wrote about how there should be a rebirth of Southern writers, all writing about the Southern way, and that's how we can make our voices known.

/JIMMY RAY
I don't know how a group of judges from Raleigh could turn that down.

/ALICE
They couldn't. I took that five dollars and put it toward my college fund.

/JIMMY RAY
How much do you have in your college fund?

/ALICE
Five dollars.
          (then)
Want a biscuit?

/JIMMY RAY
I wouldn't mind havin' a biscuit.

          (ALICE takes one over to him. He
          reaches out for it.)

/ALICE
Your hands are dirty! You don't want to eat a dirty biscuit.

/JIMMY RAY
You better feed it to me then.

/ALICE
Now, you and I were thinking the exact same thought.

          (ALICE feeds him the biscuit.)

/JIMMY RAY
You got a little wildcat about you, Alice Murphy.

/ALICE
What's that book?

          (ALICE grabs the book out of his
          toolbox.)

/JIMMY RAY
Hey there!

          (ALICE looks at the title.)

F. Scott Fitzgerald. He's a new writer.

/ALICE
          (reads)
I know who he is. "The Beautiful and Damned." Is that us, Jimmy Ray?

/JIMMY RAY
Damned if I know, but you're sure beautiful. I finished it. You can keep it.

/ALICE
If my daddy sees the title he'll kill me.

/JIMMY RAY
Read it under the covers.

#5 WHOA, MAMA

/ALICE
          (looks at poster for dance)
So, who you gonna take to the Couples’ Day dance?

/JIMMY RAY
I don't know yet.

/ALICE
Well, I'm standing right here in front of you.

/JIMMY RAY
That's not proper, you asking me.

/ALICE
I read in a book that sometimes you have to plant an idea in a boy's head.

/JIMMY RAY
Well, that might be a pretty smart book.
